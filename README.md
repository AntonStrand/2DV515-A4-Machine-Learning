# Machine Learning
My solution for assignment 4 in Web Intelligence (2DV515) at Linnaeus University

## Description
The [assingment](http://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/web-intelligence/a4/).

- In assignment 4 you shall implement the Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithm and use it on some datasets
- It can be implemented in any programming language you like
- You can work alone or in group of two students
- You shall present your application and code at an oral examination
- Note that you are not required to build a REST web service for this assignment

## Requirements
### Grade E
- [ ] Implement the Naïve Bayes algorithm, using the code structure below (you are allowed to add more classes and methods if needed)
- [ ] Train the model on the Iris and Banknote authentication datasets (see Datasets page)
- [ ] Calculate classification accuracies for both datasets (use all data for both training and testing)

### Grade C-D
- [ ] Implement code for generating confusion matrices, using the code structure below

### Grade A-B
- [ ] Implement code for n-fold cross-validation, using the code structure below
- [ ] It shall be possible to use 3, 5 or 10 folds (it is okay if your implementation supports other folds)
- [ ] Calculate accuracy score for 5-fold cross-validation on both datasets
